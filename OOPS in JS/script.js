/* Ques-: What is prototypal inheritance Behaviour of JS in OOP ?
     Ans-: When we call a method or use a property on an instance(object created using constructor function) which is not present in the constructor function pattern,
           JS looks for that method or property in the prototype of that instance and JS will keep on looking until the prototype chain ends(end of the prototype 
           chain is null).*/

// NOTE-: Do not use arrow functions in OOP, because of this keyword problem.

const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {
  // instance properties-:
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;

  // never write methods in function constructors-:
  // this.calcAge = function () {
  //   console.log(2021 - this.birthYear);
  // }; // beacause when we do this, method gets attached to every instance created fom this contructor function and hence it will increase the data inside a instance
  // irrespective of wether it is req. or not.

Person.prototype.species = 'Homo Sapiens';
console.log(parth.species);

console.log(parth.hasOwnProperty('species')); // false, beacuse it is not inherited from the constructor, it is a prototype property.

//        same name is introduced in the new version of JS than our code will use the method in the newer version.
