/* (v.imp.) Ques-: How we are able to use "e event" in _newWorkout() method considering that we have changed the "this.keyword" using "bind" while calling the _newWorkout method in the constructor function ?
            Ans-: Beacuse callback accepts a single parameter: an object based on Event describing the event that has occurred, and it returns nothing. And we are 
                  calling the addEvenListener on the form so, "e" parameter will always the information about the event occuring rergardless of "this keyword".   */

//(imp.) NOTE-: we have stored L.map().setView() in the variable "map" beacause we want to call an event listener on the map later and "leaflet offers a special type of addEventListener() method" called "map.on()" which works almost same as addEventListener() and map.on.has an argument similar to event argument in addEventListener().

// (v.imp.) NOTE-:  get used to of using libraries and frameworks and to use them it is very important to learn from their documentation.

/*(v.imp.) NOTE-: "L" in the leaflet code is a name Space or a entry point object provided by the library which have many methods attached to it. like-: INtl() in 
                   internationalisation API which have multiple methods attached to it. 
                   methods-: L.map('id') -: it accepts the "id" of the HTML code where Map is to be displayed on the website.  L.map().setView([coordinates], map Zoom value),
                   L.maker() -:  is used to create the map. 
                   L.tileLayer() -: it accepts the url of the map which is to be loaded and in that URL some customizations for the map are also present and you can learn about the customizations in the leaflet documentation.
                   "TileLayer" is the structure of the map, map is made out of multiple tiles(can learn about this on google)
                   "openstreetmap" in the URL is a open source map.*/

// navigator.geolocation.getcurrentPosition()-: 1st function gets executed when position is located, 2nd function is executed when position is not located.

/*   (v.imp.) NOTE-: If we have multiple scripts in our code than global variables of a script can be accessed by other scripts, but it depends on the order of 
                     occurence of those scripts in HTML. It means "L" Object is a global variable in leaflet script ex-: watch below */

// console.log(firstName); // firstName is defined in "others.js" script, script.js can access global variables of leaflet & others.js script but "others.js" can only global variables of leaflet Script.

/* Ques-:  Why we have used defer for script loading ?
   Ans-: 1-: Because when we use script tag at the end of the Body than script will be fetched by the DOM after "domContentLoaded event" is fired (this event is fired 
          when HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.)
         2-: Using Async-: The script is loaded asynchronously and executed immediately, means script is fetched while HTML parsing is in the process, but script gets 
                           executed immediately and HTML code has to wait till script execution is complete.
         3-: Using Defer-: script is still loaded/fetched asynchronously but executed after "domContentLoaded event is fired".  
         
         Advanatge of "Defer" over "Async"-: "domContentLoaded event is generally fired when all the HTML is parsed and all the scripts are executed" and "Async" is 
                                              the exception where DOMContentLoaded doesn't wait for the script to be loaded. So, if a very long script takes more time
                                              to get fetched by the DOM then HTML gets loaded before the script is executed, this will create problem in the website.*/
